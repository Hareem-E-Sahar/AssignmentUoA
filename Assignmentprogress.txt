uptil now I was able read a file line by line, tokenize a string and write tokens to a csv file.

Now see if changing .txt extension to .java extension works or not. Yes it does.
open csv file in append mode because it closes after writing tokens of one line to csv.
Integrate reading and tokenizing so that as soon as a line is read tokens are saved in file.


Split funcrtion does not work on dot.
The method takes a regular expression, not a string, and the dot has a special meaning in regular expressions. Escape it like so split("\\."). You need a double backslash, the second one escapes the first.

Space delimeter creates problems on first string


"[\\w--]+|[\\w++][a-zA-Z]+|\\\\d+|[\\\\^$.|?<>;=]|[()]+|[\\{}]+|[++]+|[--]+\n\n\n" works but the following does not
[==]+|[!=]+|[\w--]+|[\w++]+|[a-zA-Z]+|\d+|[\\^$.|?<>;=(){}]
